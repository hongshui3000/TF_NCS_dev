# TF_NCS_dev  

This repo is a work in progress project where the goal is to run tenserflow lite microcontroller example code on the nrf9160 using Zephyr.

##### Description

> Tensorflow examples in zephyr on nrf products:  
> Using the nrf9160dk or Thingy:91 some tensorflow lite micro examples should be able to run.  
> Some of the examples is also able to run on other nrf products like nrf52840dk, Thingy:52 
> and nrf53840dk with some changes to the code.  

## info: before you start/good to know

NB:Currently no native Windows support due to some tensorflow build dependecies. 

You need the folowing to test and/or run the projectin this repositroy:  
NCS repo and tensorflow repo, these two repositories will be downloaded using west if you follow th steps of this guide. otherwise you need to get them yourself.
Follow Zephyrs guide on how to setup command line tools and environment variables for your OS.

### How to set up this project

**Â¡!This is still undergoing testing and might not be complete or might not cover all aspects!Â¡**
Operating system: linux (Manjaro XFCE)

Note: make sure that you have the correct enviroment and tools available and installed on your operating system.
West, nRF commandline tools, python 3.X, git ect.. if you have the tools to work on sdk-nrf(https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf) then the only additional requirement is including tensorflow(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

**First step is creating a workplace\work enviroment**
Create folder called ncs(or something you like) and clone this repo in that folder using git clone.
use ``west init-l`` to initiate the repository
use ``west update`` to gett evertying (run this command twice to makes sure everything is up to date)  

or use ``west init -m <this repo link>`` in the folder you want the project. 

**Locate the tensorflow folder and update the third party downloads**
Now locate the tensorflow folder and open a terminal, run the following command:  
``make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile third_party_downloads``

#### Alternative OS (Windows)

Operating system: Windows 10  
Note: Alternative solution on Windows 10 where you need to include the prebuilt tenerflow repositroy. You also need all the above mationd toolchain's.  

**Windows 10 step 1**
Install python, west, nrf commandline tools ect... , and update your enviroment variabels.
Make a new folder somewhare(preferably under C/: disk) and name it ncs(or somwthing you prefer) open a terminal window in the folder.

### How to run an example

Make shure you have the **flatbuffers/flatbufers.h** file, this can be made runing the following in the terminal:

run: ```make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile third_party_downloads```  

or if that does not work run an exampel to build the same files, you dont acualy need to use the genrated exameple but it wil include all the files and make shure that you have the correct files. It can be done by the following command:

run: ```make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=esp generate_hello_world_esp_project```

Then you can do the following to build whit Cmake. Go to the example of your choice, build and flash yousing west.
run: ```west build -b ``<your board of choice>`` ```
run: ```west flash```

Example build for nrf9160DK:
Go to folder whit example >tf_lite_micro_example-Hello-Sinus
run: ```west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns ```
run: ```west flash```

## How to use segger system view

*Note: used for debugging purposes*
Moddify the file *profiler_sysview.c* file in path *nrf>subsys>profiler* to include ``#include <SEGGER_SYSVIEW.h>``.
In the *proj.conf* file of your project add the following:
```
CONFIG_PROFILER=y  
CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=y  
CONFIG_PROFILER_SYSVIEW=y  
CONFIG_SEGGER_SYSTEMVIEW=y  
CONFIG_TRACING=y  
```

make shure the ```autoconf.h``` file in the build folder after building your project has the following configured coretly:

```
#define CONFIG_PROFILER_SYSVIEW 1
#define CONFIG_SEGGER_SYSTEMVIEW 1
#define CONFIG_PROFILER 1
```

Download the segger Sysview program to your operating system of choice:
